# Cross-Chain Patterns — Complete Workflow Examples

All examples use `$API_KEY` as the wallet API key and `https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com` as base URL.

## Pattern 1: Swap wNEAR to USDT (Same Chain)

Most common pattern — swap within NEAR ecosystem. Swap is gasless but tokens must be in intents balance first.

```bash
# 1. Check wNEAR balance on NEAR account
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/balance?chain=near&token=wrap.near"
# Response: {"balance": "5000000000000000000000000", "token": "wrap.near", ...}
# → 5 wNEAR available

# 2. Deposit wNEAR into intents (on-chain, needs gas)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"wrap.near","amount":"1000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/deposit"

# 3. Get quote (optional — preview rate without executing)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:usdt.tether-token.near","amount_in":"1000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap/quote"
# Response: {"amount_out": "3150000", "min_amount_out": "3118500", ...}
# → 1 wNEAR ≈ 3.15 USDT

# 4. Execute swap (gasless — 1 wNEAR → USDT, min 3.0 USDT)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:usdt.tether-token.near","amount_in":"1000000000000000000000000","min_amount_out":"3000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap"
# Response: {"request_id": "...", "status": "success", "amount_out": "3150000"}
# → USDT is now in intents balance

# 5. Verify USDT in intents balance
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/balance?token=usdt.tether-token.near&source=intents"
```

## Pattern 2: Swap wNEAR to ETH (Cross-Chain)

ETH is represented as `nep141:eth.omft.near` on NEAR. After swap, ETH sits in your intents balance. Use `/intents/withdraw` to move it to your NEAR account or another chain.

```bash
# 1. Check quote for 10 wNEAR → ETH
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:eth.omft.near","amount_in":"10000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap/quote"
# Response: {"amount_out": "6420000000000000", ...}
# → 10 wNEAR ≈ 0.00642 ETH

# 2. Execute swap
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:eth.omft.near","amount_in":"10000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap"
```

## Pattern 3: Convert ETH to NEAR for Gas

Agent has bridged ETH on NEAR and needs native NEAR for gas. Requires some NEAR for deposit + unwrap steps.

```bash
# 1. Check bridged ETH balance on NEAR account
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/balance?chain=near&token=eth.omft.near"

# 2. Deposit ETH into intents (on-chain, needs gas)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"eth.omft.near","amount":"10000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/deposit"

# 3. Swap ETH → wNEAR in intents (gasless)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:eth.omft.near","token_out":"nep141:wrap.near","amount_in":"10000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap"
# → wNEAR is now in intents balance

# 4. Register storage on wrap.near if needed (on-chain, ~0.00125 NEAR)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"wrap.near"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/storage-deposit"

# 5. Withdraw wNEAR from intents to wallet (gasless)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"chain":"near","to":"YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS","amount":"WNEAR_AMOUNT","token":"wrap.near"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/withdraw"

# 6. Unwrap wNEAR to native NEAR (on-chain, needs gas)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"receiver_id":"wrap.near","method_name":"near_withdraw","args":{"amount":"WNEAR_AMOUNT"},"deposit":"1"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/call"
```

## Pattern 4: Check Rate and Swap Only If Favorable

Agent monitors rate and swaps when price is good.

```bash
# 1. Get current rate
QUOTE=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:usdt.tether-token.near","amount_in":"1000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap/quote")

AMOUNT_OUT=$(echo $QUOTE | jq -r '.amount_out')
echo "1 wNEAR = $(echo "scale=2; $AMOUNT_OUT / 1000000" | bc) USDT"

# 2. Only swap if rate is above threshold (e.g. 3.0 USDT per wNEAR)
if [ "$AMOUNT_OUT" -ge 3000000 ]; then
  curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
    -d "{\"token_in\":\"nep141:wrap.near\",\"token_out\":\"nep141:usdt.tether-token.near\",\"amount_in\":\"1000000000000000000000000\",\"min_amount_out\":\"3000000\"}" \
    "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap"
fi
```

## Pattern 5: Move Tokens to Another NEAR Account via Intents

Deposit into intents → withdraw to another account. The withdraw is **gasless** — no NEAR needed on the wallet's implicit account. **Note:** receiver must have storage on the token contract. Use `/storage-deposit` to register if needed.

```bash
# 1. Deposit wNEAR into intents balance (on-chain, needs gas)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"wrap.near","amount":"1000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/deposit"

# 2. Check intents balance
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/balance?token=wrap.near&source=intents"

# 3. Ensure receiver has storage (on-chain, ~0.00125 NEAR)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"wrap.near","account_id":"receiver.near"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/storage-deposit"

# 4. Withdraw to receiver (gasless)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"to":"receiver.near","amount":"1000000000000000000000000","token":"wrap.near","chain":"near"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/withdraw"
```

## Pattern 6: Multi-Step — Swap and Send

Agent swaps tokens then sends the result to a user. Swap result is in intents, so use `/intents/withdraw` to send.

```bash
# 1. Swap wNEAR → USDT (gasless, tokens must be in intents)
SWAP=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token_in":"nep141:wrap.near","token_out":"nep141:usdt.tether-token.near","amount_in":"5000000000000000000000000"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/swap")

AMOUNT_OUT=$(echo $SWAP | jq -r '.amount_out')

# 2. Register storage for receiver (on-chain, ~0.00125 NEAR)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"usdt.tether-token.near","account_id":"user.near"}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/storage-deposit"

# 3. Withdraw USDT from intents to user (gasless)
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"to\":\"user.near\",\"amount\":\"$AMOUNT_OUT\",\"token\":\"usdt.tether-token.near\",\"chain\":\"near\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/intents/withdraw"
```

## Pattern 7: Agent-to-Agent Payment via Check

Agent2 (buyer) pays Agent1 (seller) 1 USDC for a service using a payment check.

```bash
# === Agent2 (buyer) creates a payment check ===

# 1. Create check for 1 USDC with 24h expiry
CHECK=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"17208628f84f5d6ad33f0da3bbbeb27ffcb398eac501a31bd6ad2011e36133a1","amount":"1000000","memo":"Payment for song generation","expires_in":86400}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/create")

CHECK_ID=$(echo $CHECK | jq -r '.check_id')
CHECK_KEY=$(echo $CHECK | jq -r '.check_key')
echo "Check created: $CHECK_ID"
echo "Send this key to the seller: $CHECK_KEY"

# 2. Send check_key to Agent1 (out-of-band — via API call, message, etc.)
#    Agent1 receives: "ed25519:5Kd3NBU...base58_private_key"

# === Agent1 (seller) claims the check ===

# 3. Claim the check
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SELLER_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"check_key\":\"$CHECK_KEY\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/claim"
# Response: {"status": "success", "token": "17208...a1", "amount": "1000000", ...}

# 4. Verify funds arrived in intents balance
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $SELLER_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/balance?token=17208628f84f5d6ad33f0da3bbbeb27ffcb398eac501a31bd6ad2011e36133a1&source=intents"
# → {"balance": "1000000", ...}

# === Agent2 (buyer) verifies payment was received ===

# 5. Check status
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_API_KEY" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/status?check_id=$CHECK_ID"
# → {"status": "claimed", "claimed_at": "2026-03-12T10:35:00Z", ...}
```

### Alternative: Reclaim unclaimed check

```bash
# If Agent1 never claims and the check expired (or you want to cancel early):
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"check_id\":\"$CHECK_ID\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/reclaim"
# → {"status": "success", "amount_reclaimed": "1000000", "remaining": "0", "reclaimed_at": "..."}
# Funds return to buyer's intents balance
```

## Pattern 8: Partial Claims — Milestone-Based Payments

Agent2 (buyer) creates a check for the full project cost. Agent1 (seller) claims in parts as milestones are delivered. Buyer can reclaim unused funds.

```bash
# === Agent2 creates a 10 USDC check for a 3-milestone project ===
CHECK=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"token":"17208628f84f5d6ad33f0da3bbbeb27ffcb398eac501a31bd6ad2011e36133a1","amount":"10000000","memo":"Project: 3 milestones","expires_in":604800}' \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/create")
CHECK_ID=$(echo $CHECK | jq -r '.check_id')
CHECK_KEY=$(echo $CHECK | jq -r '.check_key')
# → 10 USDC locked, 7-day expiry

# === Agent1 claims milestone 1 (3 USDC) ===
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SELLER_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"check_key\":\"$CHECK_KEY\",\"amount\":\"3000000\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/claim"
# → {"amount_claimed": "3000000", "remaining": "7000000"}

# === Agent1 claims milestone 2 (3 USDC) ===
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SELLER_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"check_key\":\"$CHECK_KEY\",\"amount\":\"3000000\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/claim"
# → {"amount_claimed": "3000000", "remaining": "4000000"}

# === Agent2 cancels milestone 3 — reclaims remaining 4 USDC ===
curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $BUYER_API_KEY" \
  -d "{\"check_id\":\"$CHECK_ID\"}" \
  "https://api.outlayer.fastnear.com/wallet/v1/payment-check/reclaim"
# → {"amount_reclaimed": "4000000", "remaining": "0"}
# Agent1 got 6 USDC total, Agent2 got 4 USDC back
```
